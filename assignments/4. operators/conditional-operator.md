## If Statement
1.  🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ⛑ Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
  ⚡️ Operations
    * [ ] Add
    * [ ] Sub
    * [ ] Mul
    * [ ] Div

2. 🎖Write an if else statement which checks if the status is single `console.log` the message `John is single` or else `John is married`
```js
var firstName = 'John';
var status = 'single';
// Your code goes here
if (status == "single") {
  console.log("John is single");
} else {
  console.log("John is married");
}
```

3. 🎖Write a JavaScript program that takes two `integers` from user (using prompt) and alerts the larger number.
```js
// your code goes here
var numberOne = prompt("Enter a number");
var numberTwo = prompt("Enter another number");
if (numberOne > numberTwo) {
  prompt(`${numberOne} is greater out of the two numbers entered`);
} else {
  prompt(`${numberTwo} is greater out of the two numbers entered`);
}
```

4. 🎖Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign (+, -) of product of three numbers. Take those three numbers from user using `prompt`. Display an alert box with the specified sign.

```js
// Your code goes here
var noOne = prompt("Enter the first number");
var noTwo = prompt("Enter the second number");
var noThree = prompt("Enter the third number");
var productOfThreeNumbers = noOne * noTwo * noThree;
if (productOfThreeNumbers > 0)  
  alert("The sum of three numbers is '+' positive");
else {
  alert("The sum of three numbers is '-' negative");
  }
```

## Switch Statement

1. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.
* [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
* [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
* [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
* [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
* [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
* [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
* [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
* [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
* [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
* [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if  is none of the above.
```js
// Your code goes here
var a = Number(prompt("Enter a number from 0 to 9"))

switch (a) {
  case 1: 
    alert("ONE");
    break;
  case 2: 
    alert("Two");
    break;
  case 3: 
    alert("Three");
    break;
  case 4: 
    alert("Four");
    break;
  case 5: 
    alert("Five");
    break;
  case 6: 
    alert("Six");
    break;
  case 7: 
    alert("Seven");
    break;
  case 8: 
    alert("Eight");
    break;
  case 9: 
    alert("Nine");
    break;
  default: 
    alert("Please try again");
}
```

2. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take the value of `marks` (0-100) from user using `prompt` and `alert` the message (Your Grade is AA) as giver below.
* [ ] `AA` if `marks` is greater than 90.
* [ ] `AB` if `marks` is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
* [ ] `BB` if `marks` is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80
* [ ] `BC` if `marks` is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
* [ ] `CC` if `marks` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
* [ ] `CD` if `marks` is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
* [ ] `DD` if `marks` is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
* [ ] `FF` if `marks` is less than or equal to 30
```js
// Your code goes here

var marks = Number(prompt("Enter your score and i will translate it to grades"));

switch (true) {
  case (marks > 90): 
    alert("Your grade is AA"); 
    break;
  case (marks > 80 && marks <= 90): 
    alert("Your grade is AB"); 
    break;  
  case (marks > 70 && marks <= 80): 
    alert("Your grade is BB"); 
    break;
  case (marks > 60 && marks <= 70): 
    alert("Your grade is BC"); 
    break;
  case (marks > 50 && marks <= 60 ): 
    alert("Your grade is CC"); 
    break;
  case (marks > 40 && marks <= 50): 
    alert("Your grade is CD"); 
    break;
  case (marks > 30 && marks <= 40): 
    alert("Your grade is DD"); 
    break;
  case (marks >= 30): 
    alert("Your grade is FF"); 
    break;
  default:
    alert ("Please enter a number less than or equal to 100");
}

```
