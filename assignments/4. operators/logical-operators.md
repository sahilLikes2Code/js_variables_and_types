# Logical Operator

1. ðŸ¥‡What's the output of the following, write the output next to the code as comment.

* [ ] Logical AND operation

```js
true  && true; //output
true  && false; //false
false && true; //false
false && false; //false
"foo" && "bar"; // bar
"bar" && "foo"; // foo
"foo" && ""; // ""
""    && "foo"; // ""
" "   && "John" && "" && false //""
false && "Hey" && undefined //false 
"undefined" && false && 42 //undefined
```

* [ ] Logical OR operation
```js
true  || true; //true
true  || false; //true
false || true; //true
false || false; //false
"foo" || "bar"; //foo
"bar" || "foo"; //bar
"foo" || ""; //foo 
""    || "foo"; //foo
" "   || "John" || "" || false //" "
false || "Hey" || undefined //Hey
"undefined" || false || 42 //"undefined"
```

2. ðŸ¥ˆYou have two variables i.e `isGuestOneVeg` and  `isGuestTwoVeg` according to the value using logical && and || opeartor do the following.

* [ ] If both are veg "Only offer up vegan dishes."
* [ ] At least one veg  "Make sure to offer up some vegan options."
* [ ] Else, "Offer up anything on the menu"
```js
let isGuestOneVeg = false;
let isGuestTwoVeg = false;
// Your code goes here
if (isGuestOneVeg && isGuestTwoVeg) {
    console.log("Only offer up vegan dishes");
} else if (isGuestOneVeg || isGuestTwoVeg) {
    console.log("Make sure to offer up some vegan options.");
} else {
    console.log("Offer up anything on the menu");
}
```


3. ðŸŽ–Using the variable `temperature` and logical operators do the following
* [ ] If temperature is less then 32 alert "It is freezing outside"
* [ ] If the temperature is greater then 110 alert "It is hot outside"
* [ ] else 'Go for it. It is pretty nice out'
```js
let temperature = 4;
// Your code goes here
if (temperature < 32) {
    alert("It is freezing outside");
} else if (temperature > 110) {
    alert("It is hot outside")
} else {
    alert("Go for it. It is pretty nice out")
}

```

4. ðŸŽ– Output of this and the reason behind the output.
```js
alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) ); // first number 1 will be prompted on the screen which is a truthy value. Following which undefined will be displayed as after alert(1) is being treated as a function with argument 1, both of which are undefined
```
